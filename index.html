      <p>
        ICPC is an annual algorithmic programming competition where
        teams of three college students compete to solve as many challenging
        programming problems as they can within 5 hours. ICPC is separated
        into two stages: <b>regional</b> and <b>world finals</b>. The top 3
        teams in each region advance to the world finals, which
        are held in a different country each year.

        SIGICPC is for anyone who likes competitive programming, but is
        particularly targeted towards those who want to do well in
        the competition. We meet every week to practice solving
        challenging problems. Being able to solve challenging
        problems is particularly helpful for technical interviews as well.
